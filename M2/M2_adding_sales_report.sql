Task 2

of the following tables by using the relevant JOIN clause:
 
	Customers table: The customer id and full name.
	Orders table: The order id and cost.
	Menus table: The menus name.
	MenusItems table: course name and starter name.

Task 3

Little Lemon need you to find all menu items for which more than 2 orders have been placed. You can carry out this task by creating a subquery 
that lists the menu names from the menus table for any order quantity with more than 2.

	Use the ANY operator in a subquery
	The outer query should be used to select the menu name from the menus table.
	The inner query should check if any item quantity in the order table is more than 2.

Task 4

Little Lemon need you to create a procedure that displays the maximum ordered quantity in the Orders table. 

Creating this procedure will allow Little Lemon to reuse the logic implemented in the procedure easily without retyping the same code over again and 
again to check the maximum quantity.

/*
Task 5

In the second task, Little Lemon need you to help them to create a prepared statement called GetOrderDetail. This prepared statement will help to reduce 
the parsing time of queries. It will also help to secure the database from SQL injections.

The prepared statement should accept one input argument, the CustomerID value, from a variable. 

The statement should return the order id, the quantity and the order cost from the Orders table.â€¯

Once you create the prepared statement, you can create a variable called id and assign it value of 1.

/*
Task 6

Create a stored procedure called CancelOrder. Little Lemon want to use this stored procedure to delete an order record based on the user input of the order id.

Creating this procedure will allow Little Lemon to cancel any order by specifying the order id value in the procedure parameter without typing the entire SQL 
delete statement.
